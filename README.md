### Installation

Open project with fresh Android Studio and run.

### TBD

These things I expected to be done on time:
- Fix navigation from list to info screen
- Write test to mapper (at least)

These things I planned to enhance after given 3 hours:
- Extract common composable to core (like shorten name in circle)
- Add key to LazyList
- Enhance mapper to make it possible to convert nullable fields
- Make incoming objects fields nullable, as we can't rely on contract
- Add error handling and reflect it to UI via channel and snackbar
- Add DB for caching
- Improve list performance with paging
- Write Unit and end-to-end tests
